# Azure Storage Choices for an E-commerce Platform

This document outlines the recommended Azure storage services for key data categories in an e-commerce platform, along with justifications for each choice.

## 1. Product Catalog
*   **Data:** Detailed product information, specifications, variants, categories, pricing, images/videos metadata.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB (API for NoSQL - e.g., Core (SQL) API or MongoDB API):** For primary product details.
    *   **Azure Blob Storage:** For product images/videos (linked from Cosmos DB).
    *   **Azure Cognitive Search (Optional but Recommended):** For advanced search capabilities.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Cosmos DB:** Offers schema flexibility for diverse product attributes, global distribution for low-latency access, and elastic scaling for read-heavy catalog browsing. Its multi-model nature allows choosing an API that best fits development preferences.
    *   **Blob Storage:** Cost-effective and optimized for storing large binary objects like images and videos. Using it with Azure CDN can further enhance performance.
    *   **Cognitive Search:** Provides a richer search experience (full-text search, faceted navigation, suggestions) essential for product discovery, populated from Cosmos DB.

## 2. Customer Accounts
*   **Data:** User profiles, authentication details, addresses, contact information, preferences.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C):** For identity management (authentication, sign-up, sign-in, profile management).
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB (Core (SQL) API or other NoSQL API) or Azure SQL Database:** For storing additional user profile information (e.g., detailed preferences, non-critical profile attributes).
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Azure AD B2C:** A dedicated and secure identity management service that handles authentication complexities, supports social identity providers, and is highly scalable.
    *   **Cosmos DB/SQL Database:** Cosmos DB offers schema flexibility for evolving user profiles. Azure SQL Database provides strong transactional consistency if needed for specific profile data, though AD B2C handles core sensitive identity data.

## 3. Order Management
*   **Data:** Shopping cart, order history, payment transactions, shipping status, invoices.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL:** For core order data.
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB (Optional, for active shopping carts):**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Azure SQL Database (or PostgreSQL/MySQL):** Relational databases are ideal for transactional order data due to strong consistency (ACID properties) and ability to handle complex relationships. They offer robust data integrity and scalability.
    *   **Cosmos DB (for shopping cart):** Can handle high write volumes for frequently updated temporary cart data with good performance. Final orders reside in the relational DB.

## 4. Inventory Management
*   **Data:** Real-time stock levels per product/variant, warehouse locations.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for PostgreSQL/MySQL:** For the core inventory ledger.
    *   **Azure Cache for Redis (Optional, as a caching layer):**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Azure SQL Database (or PostgreSQL/MySQL):** Offers strong consistency and atomic operations critical for preventing overselling. Stored procedures can encapsulate inventory logic.
    *   **Azure Cache for Redis:** Can cache stock levels for extremely high read scenarios, reducing load on the primary database and providing ultra-low latency, with writes still going to the database.

## 5. User Sessions & Personalization
*   **Data:** Browsing history, temporary cart data, user behavior for recommendations.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Cache for Redis:** For active user session data (e.g., temporary cart).
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB (API for NoSQL):** For persistent browsing history and user behavior data.
    *   **Azure Blob Storage (via Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 - Optional):** For raw clickstream data.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Azure Cache for Redis:** Extremely fast for short-lived session data.
    *   **Cosmos DB:** Scales to ingest and store large volumes of semi-structured user activity data for long-term personalization.
    *   **Blob Storage/ADLS Gen2:** Cost-effective for large raw data volumes for batch processing or analytics.

## 6. Product Reviews & Ratings
*   **Data:** User-generated content, comments, scores.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Cosmos DB (API for NoSQL):**
    *   **Azure Cognitive Search (Optional):** To index and search reviews.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Cosmos DB:** Excellent for user-generated content due to schema flexibility, scalability for reads/writes, and global distribution.
    *   **Cognitive Search:** Enables searching within review text or filtering.

## 7. Static Assets & Media
*   **Data:** Product images, videos, marketing banners, CSS/JS files.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Blob Storage:**
    *   **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Blob Storage:** Designed for storing large unstructured data at low cost.
    *   **Azure CDN:** Caches static assets globally, reducing latency and improving load times. Essential for website performance.

## 8. Logs & Telemetry
*   **Data:** Application performance monitoring, user activity tracking, security logs.
*   **Azure Service(s):**
    *   **Azure Monitor (Log Analytics and Application Insights):**
    *   **Azure Blob Storage (via Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 - Optional):** For long-term archival or big data processing.
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Azure Monitor:** Comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry. Application Insights for APM, Log Analytics for querying.
    *   **Blob Storage/ADLS Gen2:** Cost-effective for historical log archival and big data pipelines.
