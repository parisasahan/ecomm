# High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy for E-commerce Azure Solution

This document outlines the High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) strategies for the key Azure services and application components of the e-commerce platform.

## 1. High Availability (HA)

High Availability ensures that the application remains operational and accessible during component failures or localized outages within a region, typically through redundancy and automatic failover.

### a. Azure Service HA Capabilities

*   **Azure SQL Database:**
    *   **Built-in HA:** Provides various service tiers (General Purpose, Business Critical, Hyperscale) with built-in HA.
        *   **Locally-Redundant Storage (LRS):** Multiple synchronous data copies within one datacenter.
        *   **Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) (for higher tiers):** Synchronously replicates data across three Azure Availability Zones (AZs) in the primary region, enabling automatic failover to another zone during a zonal outage.
        *   **Business Critical & Premium Tiers:** Utilize Always On availability groups for enhanced resilience, multiple readable replicas, and faster failover.
        *   **Hyperscale Tier:** Employs a unique architecture with zone-redundant storage for data, offering rapid scaling and high resilience.
    *   **SLA:** Offers high uptime SLAs (up to 99.995% for Business Critical with ZRS).
    *   **Automatic Failover:** Managed by Azure within the region.

*   **Azure Cosmos DB:**
    *   **Built-in HA:** Natively designed for high availability.
        *   **Regional HA:** Automatically replicates data across multiple fault domains and upgrade domains (minimum 3 replicas, 4 for multi-region accounts) within a region, ensuring automatic failover.
        *   **Availability Zones:** Can be configured for zone redundancy, distributing replicas across AZs within a region for protection against zonal failures.
    *   **SLA:** 99.99% for single-region accounts; 99.999% for multi-region accounts (with relaxed consistency).
    *   **Automatic Failover:** Managed by Azure within the region. For multi-region accounts, failover to another region can be automatic or manual, based on configuration.

*   **Azure Blob Storage:**
    *   **Built-in HA:**
        *   **LRS (Locally-Redundant Storage):** Three synchronous copies within a single physical location.
        *   **ZRS (Zone-Redundant Storage):** Three synchronous copies across different AZs in the primary region.
        *   **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage):** Asynchronously replicates data to a secondary region (3 additional copies).
        *   **RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage):** Same as GRS, plus read-only access to data in the secondary region.
    *   **SLA:** Strong SLAs (e.g., 99.9% for LRS, 99.99% for ZRS read/write).
    *   **Failover (GRS/RA-GRS):** Microsoft manages failover to the secondary region during a regional disaster.

*   **Azure Cache for Redis:**
    *   **Built-in HA:**
        *   **Standard/Premium Tiers:** Offer a primary/secondary replica setup with automatic failover.
        *   **Premium Tier (Zone Redundancy):** Deploys cache replicas across different AZs.
        *   **Premium Tier (Geo-replication):** Asynchronously replicates data to another region (primarily for DR).
    *   **SLA:** Up to 99.9% for Standard/Premium tiers.

*   **Azure App Service / Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Application Layer):**
    *   **Azure App Service:**
        *   Runs on Azure's HA infrastructure (fault/upgrade domains).
        *   **Availability Zones (Premium v2/v3):** App Service Plans can be deployed with zone redundancy.
        *   Integrated load balancing.
    *   **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**
        *   Azure-managed, HA control plane (can be zone-redundant).
        *   Node pools can span multiple AZs.
        *   Kubernetes handles pod HA (deployments, replica sets, health probes).
        *   Integrates with Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway.
    *   **SLA:** App Service (up to 99.95%); AKS control plane (up to 99.95% with AZs). Application uptime also depends on its design.

*   **Azure AD B2C:**
    *   **Built-in HA:** Globally distributed, highly available identity management service, resilient to datacenter/regional failures.
    *   **SLA:** 99.9%.
    *   **Automatic Failover:** Managed by Microsoft.

*   **Azure Cognitive Search:**
    *   **Built-in HA:**
        *   **Replicas:** Distributes workload across multiple replicas for query load balancing and HA (min 2 for read HA, 3 for read-write HA).
        *   **Availability Zones (Standard tiers+):** Replicas can be deployed across AZs (min 2 replicas for read-only AZ, 3+ for read-write AZ).
    *   **SLA:** Up to 99.9% when configured with sufficient replicas.

*   **Azure CDN:**
    *   **Built-in HA:** Globally distributed service with multiple Points of Presence (PoPs). Traffic automatically routes to other PoPs if one is unavailable. Relies on origin server HA.
    *   **SLA:** High SLAs for content delivery (e.g., 99.9%).

### b. Application Layer Design for HA
*   **Stateless Services:** Design application components (APIs, microservices) to be stateless. Externalize state to services like Azure Cache for Redis or Azure Cosmos DB.
*   **Load Balancing:** Utilize Azure Load Balancer (Layer 4) or Azure Application Gateway/Azure Front Door (Layer 7) to distribute traffic across multiple application instances.
*   **Redundancy:** Deploy multiple instances of application components across different fault domains or Availability Zones.
*   **Health Probes:** Implement comprehensive health probes that load balancers use to detect and isolate unhealthy instances.
*   **Resiliency Patterns:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient faults and circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures when interacting with dependent services.

## 2. Disaster Recovery (DR)

Disaster Recovery ensures business continuity by restoring services in a different geographical region if the primary region experiences a major outage.

### a. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
*(These are example targets and must be defined based on specific business impact analysis)*
*   **Critical Functions (Order Processing, Inventory, Product Catalog, Customer Accounts):**
    *   **RPO (Max Data Loss):** 15 minutes to 1 hour.
    *   **RTO (Max Downtime):** 2 to 4 hours.
*   **Less Critical Functions (e.g., some analytics data, non-essential logs):**
    *   **RPO:** 4 to 24 hours.
    *   **RTO:** 8 to 24 hours.

### b. Backup and Restore

*   **Azure SQL Database:**
    *   **Backup:** Automated backups (full, differential, transaction log) with Point-In-Time Restore (PITR) capability (configurable retention, e.g., 7-35 days). Long-Term Retention (LTR) available for up to 10 years in Azure Blob Storage.
    *   **Restore:** Restore to any point in time within retention creates a new database. Geo-restore allows restoring from geo-replicated backups to another region.

*   **Azure Cosmos DB:**
    *   **Backup:**
        *   **Periodic Backup (Default):** Automated online backups taken (e.g., every 4 hours), last 2 backups typically retained. Restore via Azure support.
        *   **Point-In-Time Restore (PITR - if enabled):** Continuous backups allowing restore to any point within the last 30 days. Self-service restore.
    *   **Restore:** Data is restored to a new Cosmos DB account.

*   **Azure Blob Storage:**
    *   **Data Protection Features:**
        *   **Soft Delete:** Retains deleted blobs for a configurable period.
        *   **Blob Versioning:** Automatically maintains previous versions of blobs.
        *   **Point-in-Time Restore for Block Blobs:** (Requires versioning, soft delete, change feed) Allows restoring block blob data to a previous state.
        *   **Snapshots:** User-created point-in-time copies.
        *   **`Copy-Blob` operations:** Programmatic or manual copies to other accounts/regions.
    *   **Restore:** Utilize undelete, restore from versions, PITR, or use snapshots/copies.

### c. Cross-Region Replication/Failover

*   **Azure SQL Database:**
    *   **Active Geo-Replication:** Create readable secondary databases in different regions. Failover is manual.
    *   **Auto-Failover Groups:** Builds on geo-replication, grouping databases for coordinated failover. Provides listener endpoints that redirect to the current primary. Supports automatic or manual failover.

*   **Azure Cosmos DB:**
    *   **Multi-Region Writes:** Replicate data to multiple Azure regions. Any region can accept writes.
    *   **Failover Priorities:** Define failover order for regions. Automatic failover to the next preferred region can be configured if a region becomes unavailable.

*   **Azure Blob Storage:**
    *   **GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage):** Data asynchronously replicated to a secondary region. Microsoft initiates failover.
    *   **RA-GRS (Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage):** Same as GRS, plus read access to the secondary region's data (useful for DR read scenarios or verifying replication).

*   **Application Layer (App Service / AKS) & Traffic Management:**
    *   **Multi-Region Deployment:** Deploy application instances to primary and DR regions.
    *   **Azure Front Door:** Recommended for global HTTP/S load balancing, WAF, and faster failover. Provides anycast routing and can direct traffic to the healthy DR region based on health probes and failover configuration.
    *   **Azure Traffic Manager:** DNS-based traffic routing (priority, performance, geographic). Failover time depends on DNS TTL.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use services like Azure App Configuration with geo-replication to manage application configurations and facilitate updates during failover.
    *   **Stateless Design:** Critical for seamless failover; avoid session stickiness at the global load balancer if possible.

### d. DR Testing
*   **Importance:** Regular DR drills are essential to validate the DR strategy, procedures, and ensure RPO/RTO targets can be met.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Simulate regional outages for various components.
    2.  Test failover processes for databases, storage, and the application layer.
    3.  Verify data integrity and full application functionality in the DR region.
    4.  Measure the actual RPO and RTO achieved during the test.
    5.  Document lessons learned and update the DR plan accordingly.
*   **Frequency:** Conduct DR tests periodically (e.g., semi-annually or annually), aligned with business criticality and any significant architectural changes.

This HA/DR strategy provides a framework for ensuring the e-commerce platform is resilient, can recover from disasters, and meets defined availability targets. It requires ongoing review and refinement.
